# PythonForGenomicDataProject

Python project for handling fasta files, basic operations on finding ORFs (longest, shortest, position of occurence, id of sequence in which it occurs etc.)
for any given reading frame (choices 1, 2, and 3), handling repeats (most frequently occuring, id of occurence etc.) for any given length of repeat.

This project is part of the final assignment in the course "Python for Genomic Data Science" (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-genomics?specialization=genomic-data-science)
offered by "The Johns Hopkins Univeristy" in coursera (www.coursera.org).
